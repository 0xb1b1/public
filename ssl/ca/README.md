# Root Certificate Authorities

## Why?
I use self-signed CAs to test services internally and to secure privately-used services.

## Can I trust you?
**No.** You *cannot* trust anybody with your data. Using self-signed certificates, bad actors could perform a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack. Please only install a Certificate Authority of you strongly believe the person/people behind it will not do harm.
